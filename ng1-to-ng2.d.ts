/**
 * UIViewNgUpgrade is a component bridge from ng1 ui-view to ng2 ui-view
 *
 * When a ui-router for ng1 is registering a state it checks if a view's
 * `component:` is an ng2 Component class. If so, it creates a special ng1 template
 * which references this component, i.e., <ui-view-ng-upgrade></ui-view-ng-upgrade>
 *
 * See that code by searching ng1-to-ng2 source for: "$stateProvider.decorator"
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ng1-to-ng2 component bridge process:
 *
 * 1)
 * When an ng1 template creates a ui-view which is targeted by a ng2 Component,
 *
 * ```
 * <a ui-sref="foo">Go to foo</a>
 * <div ui-view> <!-- ui-view created in ng1 template -->
 * </div> <!-- targeted with { component: Ng2RoutedComponent } -->
 * ```
 *
 * the state decorator spits out a custom template.  That template loads this
 * ng2 Component adapter as a downgraded-to-ng1 directive.
 *
 * ```
 * <a ui-sref="foo">Go to foo</a>
 * <div ui-view> <!-- decorated template references the downgraded component -->
 *   <ui-view-ng-upgrade> <!-- downgraded adapter component -->
 *   </ui-view-ng-upgrade>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * This downgraded ng2 Component then creates a child UIView (ng2 component)
 *
 * ```
 * <a ui-sref="foo">Go to foo</a>
 * <div ui-view> <!-- custom template references the downgraded component -->
 *   <ui-view-ng-upgrade> <!-- ng2 component adapter downgraded to ng1-->
 *     <ui-view> <!-- pure ng2 ui-view -->
*      </ui-view>
 *   </ui-view-ng-upgrade>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * which in turn is filled with the routed ng2 component.
 *
 * ```
 * <a ui-sref="foo">Go to foo</a>
 * <div ui-view> <!-- ng1 ui-view -->
 *   <ui-view-ng-upgrade> <!-- ng2 component adapter (downgraded to ng1)-->
 *     <ui-view> <!-- pure ng2 ui-view -->
 *       <ng2-routed-component> <!-- ng2 component hosted in ng2 ui-view -->
 *         <h1>ng2 routed component contents</h1>
 *       </ng2-routed-component>
 *     </ui-view>
 *   </ui-view-ng-upgrade>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * This adapter exposes exposes the parent view context (ParentUIViewInject)
 * as an ng2 DI Provider, which the nested ng2 UIView requires.
 *
 * It gets the ParentUIViewContext information (from the parent ng1 ui-view) by walking
 * up the DOM and grabbing the .data('$uiView') which the ng1 ui-view directive exposes.
